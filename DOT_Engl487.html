              <p>Iowa Department of Transportation | May 2019 - September 2019</p>
<p>Over the course of the 2019 Summer, I worked as a web design intern for the Iowa Department of Transportation. My main project was to work on a website redesign for the Research Department and in my down time, I worked on smaller projects for the web design team in the Strategic Communication Department.</p></div>

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>The Research Department wanted to redesign their webpages. I created a design in Adobe XD with inspiration from Google Analytics, other state DOT websites, and current web design trends. After the design was finalized, I made updates to temporary CMS pages to practice then the real CMS using HMTL, CSS, JavaScript, and DotNetNuke tools.</p>

		  <h6>Purpose</h6>
				<p>This project is the reason I was hired. The research team wanted to redesign their entire website to modernize the design and have it better reflect their current practices and principles.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
				<p>The audience for their website is researchers and academics, mostly around the state of Iowa, and people who work for the Department of Transportantion. The research team further catagorized the audience into three catagories: people who are currently working with the DOT, people who want to work with the DOT, and people who want to learn more about the research department. I based the website design around these three catagories.</p>
		  <h6>Process</h6>
				<p>This project took the entire summer. I started by researching other DOT research websites and current web design trends. I then came up with several homepage designs. At this point, I started weekly meetings to adjust or recreate aspects of the design. When we finalized the design, I create a mock version on the content management system. When that was finalized, I finally implemented the design.</p>

			<div class="col-12">
		  <h6>Purpose</h6>
				<p>The purpose of create this prototype was to make the implementation of the project quicker. Some of the changes made to the design were small, but there were others that were quite large. If I had started out designing the website on the content management system, deciding design choices would have taken much longer.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
				<p>The primary audience for this design for this part of the project is the people who would be using the website; however, because this is a prototype I also had to design this for the research department. They are the ones who approved, altered, or blocked the design.</p>
		  <h6>Process</h6>
				<p>For this part of the project, I met with the research department on a weekly basis. At meetings we discussed my progress and questions. I showed them the changes I had made based on their comments and we talked about what I should do duing the next week. I used Adobe XD so I could show them a functional prototype of a website and how the pieces would interact with each other.</p>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12">
		  <h6>Purpose</h6>
				<p>The icons are an important part of the homepage design. They create a visual the user can identify with. My goal was to help modernize the look and feel of this webpage.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
				The research team narrowed down their website audience into three seperate catagories: people who are currently working with the DOT, people who want to work with the DOT, and people who want to learn more about the research department. I created the icons to represent these groups of people.
		  <h6>Process</h6>
				<p>I started off by research icons for various words like working and research. This research helped me conceptualize what people thought of when they heard the words. I used the to create four variations of each audience category. I met with the research team so they could give me their opinion on which icons I should further develop. The finalized icons appear on the current homepage for the research website.Below are the finalized icons.</p>

		  <h6>Purpose</h6>
				<p>In the future, the research team wants to have a newsfeed on their homepage. They also want an article thumbnail to go with each article. The way the newfeed is set up, either every article must have a thumbnail or none of them can have a thumbnail. They asked me to design generic images for various topics in case an article did not have a thumbnail image to go with it.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
				<p>The research department's mailing list has over 1,000 subscribers. Many of the people on the mailing list are project partners or contracts. They want to recieve information on upcoming deadlines, future, current, and past projects, and project guidelines.</p>
		  <h6>Process</h6>
				<p>To start this project, I had the research team come up with topics they would need images for. I created several styles of images for most of the topics using Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. I presented the first draft of thumbnails to the research team. This project was still in process when I finished with my internship so I never got to create a second draft.</p>

			<div class="col-12">
		  <h6>Purpose</h6>
				<p>A user survey done in December of 2018 showed that many users were upset or confused by the organization of the DOT website. While the homepage is fairly organized, most of the pages after this are just filled with too many links. My goal for this project was to make several suggestions on how to organize the website better.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
				<p>Anyone in the state of Iowa may visit the DOT website. Most of these people will be drivers. The age range can be 14 or 15 year olds looking for information about driver's permits to elderly people looking at how often they need to renew their driver's license. One interesting, common experience shared by all audience that I needed to consider was the Iowa weather.</p>
		  <h6>Process</h6>
				<p>To make suggestions, I needed to understand the entire website better. I created a site map in excel to see where all the links went, count the number of repeated links, and understand how the website is currently organized. After I created the site map, I created a new organization scheme with no repeated links. I then looked at results from a user survey to see where frustation points were and what they suggested could be better about the homepage design and organization. I presented my findings on my last day.</p>

						<li>Lower the opacity to make words more readable</li>
						<li>Use a mega menu or bread crumbs to organize the website instead of a large list of links</li>

		 	<p>I recreated several charts from the zero fatalities program for the Strategic Communication team. This needed to be done because the previous charts were made with flash and because many browers are about to no longer support flash, the charts needed to be recreated with JavaScript.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
			 <p>The audience for this is people who go to the zero fatalities program website. The zero fatalities program is one of Iowa's prevection plan for fatal car accidents.</p>
		  <h6>Process</h6>
			<p>The charts were already designed when I got them. All I needed to do was recreate the design. To do this, I manipulated the JavaScript from google charts to imitated the color, numbers, and chart form.</p>

			<p>I was given this assignment by the strategic communication team. The Bureau of Investigation wanted to create a brochure that fit with the DOT brand standards, but were not sure how to do this. I was given this assignment to make sure the design was modern and fit with the DOT brand.</p>
				
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
				<p>This was a brochure that is meant to be given out at career fairs. Because of the amount of positions, the age range is anyone one from college students to people close to retirement. The main commonality between everyone who would use this brochure is that they are all looking for a job in law enforcement.</p>
				
		   <h6>Process</h6>
		  <p>For this assignment, I was given a block of text to turn into a brochure. Because everything was already written, I only edited the text. I started off by creating a two panel layout for the job descriptions. I then researched brochure design cover pages. I drew out a design that I thought would fit well then created the design in InDesign. I made adjustments based on what my supervisor and the team from the Bureau of Investigations suggested.</p>

		  <h6>Purpose</h6>
		  <p>The Iowa driver's permit manual, a document people can read to study for their permit test and learn more about the rules of the road, is being rewritten by the Strategic Communication deparment. I read, editied, and made suggestions about this manual as a new pair of eyes.</p>
		  <h6>Audience</h6>
		  <p>The audience for this manual is primarily 14 and 15 year old students who are trying to get their driver's permit. However this document may also be read by older drivers or people who are trying to get a new or different class on their license. Because of this the reading level of the document should be something that everyone can read.</p>
		  <h6>Process</h6>
		  <p>To edit this document, I did several read throughs. The first time I read, I did so word by word looking for spelling and grammar errors. The second time I read, I did so paragram by paragraph looking for continunity and sentence structure problems. The last two times I read thought the document, I edited for arrangment and comprehension issues.</p>
